# 🧭 Eckohaus Orchestration Pilot

_© 2025 Eckohaus Ltd — Internal Research & Development Repository_  
_This repository underpins the automated compliance orchestration system integrating Eckohaus Ltd’s UK filings (Companies House, HMRC) with internal workflow automation._

---

## 🧩 Overview

The **Eckohaus Orchestration Pilot** is an internal proof-of-concept that connects Companies House data with automated audit trails and reminder systems.

It operates across **test**, **live**, and **weekly** workflows, using GitHub Actions to:
- Query Companies House APIs
- Archive and version responses as JSON
- Append entries to a persistent orchestration ledger
- Prepare for future event-sequenced automation (accounts & confirmation filings)
